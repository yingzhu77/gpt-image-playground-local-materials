# <img src="./public/favicon.svg" alt="Project Logo" width="30" height="30" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px;"> GPT Image Playground

A web-based playground to interact with OpenAI's GPT image models (`gpt-image-2.5-flare`, `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`, and `gpt-image-2`) for generating and editing images.

> **Local materials fork:** This repository is derived from [alasano/gpt-image-playground](https://github.com/alasano/gpt-image-playground) under the MIT license. It adds a server-side API gate, preflight confirmation, 16:9 size presets, transparent PNG handling, original-byte plus JSON metadata archival, and proxy-aware timeout diagnostics. See [docs/LOCAL_SETUP.zh-CN.md](docs/LOCAL_SETUP.zh-CN.md) for the local workflow.

> **Note:** The playground defaults to `gpt-image-2.5-flare`, OpenAI's fast default model. All three models support arbitrary resolutions up to 4K (with constraint validation) and transparent backgrounds (preview on `gpt-image-2`). The `gpt-image-2.5` models add the `xhigh` and `max` quality tiers. Retired models (`gpt-image-1`, `gpt-image-1-mini`, `gpt-image-1.5`) can no longer be selected, but images generated with them remain visible in the history with their original cost breakdown.

## ✨ Features

*   **🎨 Image Generation Mode:** Create new images from text prompts.
*   **🖌️ Image Editing Mode:** Modify existing images (up to 16 source images per request) based on text prompts and optional masks.
*   **⚙️ Full API Parameter Control:** Access and adjust all relevant parameters supported by the OpenAI Images API directly through the UI, in both generate and edit mode (size, quality including the `xhigh`/`max` tiers, output format, compression, background, moderation, number of images).
*   **📐 Custom Resolutions:** Pick from the 2048×2048, 3072×2048 or 2048×3072 presets or enter an arbitrary Width × Height with live validation against the model constraints (multiples of 16, max 3840px per edge, ≤ 3:1 aspect ratio, 655,360 to 8,294,400 total pixels).
*   **🎭 Integrated Masking Tool:** Easily create or upload masks directly within the editing mode to specify areas for modification. Draw directly on the image to generate a mask.

     > ⚠️ Please note that the GPT Image models' masking feature does not guarantee 100% control at this time. <br>1) [It's a known & acknowledged model limitation.](https://community.openai.com/t/gpt-image-1-problems-with-mask-edits/1240639/37) <br>2) [OpenAI are looking to address it in a future update.](https://community.openai.com/t/gpt-image-1-problems-with-mask-edits/1240639/41)

*   **🖼️ Flexible Image Output View:** View generated image batches as a grid or select individual images for a closer look.
*   **🚀 Send to Edit:** Quickly send any generated or history image directly to the editing form.
*   **📋 Paste to Edit:** Paste images directly from your clipboard into the Edit mode's source image area.
*   **💾 Storage:** Supports two modes via `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_STORAGE_MODE`:
    *   **Filesystem (default):** Images saved to `./generated-images` on the server.
    *   **IndexedDB:** Images saved directly in the browser's IndexedDB (ideal for serverless deployments).
    *   Generation history metadata is always saved in the browser's local storage.

## ▲ Deploy to Vercel

🚨 *CAUTION: If you deploy from `main` or `master` branch, your Vercel deployment will be **publicly available** to anyone who has the URL. Deploying from other branches will require users to be logged into Vercel (on your team) to access the preview build.* 🚨

You can deploy your own instance of this playground to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/alasano/gpt-image-1-playground&env=OPENAI_API_KEY,NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_STORAGE_MODE,APP_PASSWORD&envDescription=OpenAI%20API%20Key%20is%20required.%20Set%20storage%20mode%20to%20indexeddb%20for%20Vercel%20deployments.&project-name=gpt-image-playground&repository-name=gpt-image-playground)

You will be prompted to enter your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `APP_PASSWORD` during the deployment setup. For Vercel deployments, it's required to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_STORAGE_MODE` to `indexeddb`. 

Note: If `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_STORAGE_MODE` is not set, the application will automatically detect if it's running on Vercel (using the `VERCEL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV` environment variables) and default to `indexeddb` mode in that case. Otherwise (e.g., running locally), it defaults to `fs` mode. You can always explicitly set the variable to `fs` or `indexeddb` to override this automatic behavior.

## 🚀 Getting Started [Local Deployment]

Follow these steps to get the playground running locally.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 22 or later required)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), or [bun](https://bun.sh/)

### 1. Set Up API Key 🟢

You need an OpenAI API key to use this application. 

⚠️ [Your OpenAI Organization needs to be verified to use GPT Image models](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification)

1.  If you don't have a `.env.local` file, create one.
2.  Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env.local` file:

    ```dotenv
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ENABLE_IMAGE_API=false
    NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_STORAGE_MODE=fs
    ```

    `ENABLE_IMAGE_API` defaults to `false`: the page stays usable, but generation and edit requests are rejected on the server before any SDK or network call. Set it to `true` only when you intend to make real API requests.

    **Important:** Keep your API key secret. The `.env.local` file is included in `.gitignore` by default to prevent accidental commits.

    When running locally, you can also use the in-app “配置 API Key / 启用生成” dialog. It sends the key only to the same-origin loopback server (`127.0.0.1` / `localhost`), can update `.env.local` while preserving other lines, and never exposes the key to the browser bundle or storage.

For the local material workflow used in this repository (Chinese setup guide, confirmation flow, size presets, original-byte archival and metadata), see [docs/LOCAL_SETUP.zh-CN.md](docs/LOCAL_SETUP.zh-CN.md).

#### 🟡 (Optional) IndexedDB Mode (for serverless hosts) [e.g. Vercel]

For environments where the filesystem is read-only or ephemeral (like Vercel serverless functions), you can configure the application to store generated images directly in the browser's IndexedDB using Dexie.js.

Set the following environment variable in your `.env.local` file or directly in your hosting provider's UI (like Vercel):

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_STORAGE_MODE=indexeddb
```

When this variable is set to `indexeddb`:
*   The server API (`/api/images`) will return the image data as base64 (`b64_json`) instead of saving it to disk.
*   The client-side application will decode the base64 data and store the image blob in IndexedDB.
*   Images will be served directly from the browser's storage using Blob URLs.

If this variable is **not set** or has any other value, the application defaults to the standard behavior of saving images to the `./generated-images` directory on the server's filesystem.

**Note:** If `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_STORAGE_MODE` is not set, the application will automatically detect if it's running on Vercel (using the `VERCEL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV` environment variables) and default to `indexeddb` mode in that case. Otherwise (e.g., running locally), it defaults to `fs` mode. You can always explicitly set the variable to `fs` or `indexeddb` to override this automatic behavior.

#### 🟡 (Optional) Use a Custom API Endpoint

> **Local material branch:** custom endpoints are intentionally disabled. The server always uses the official OpenAI endpoint and ignores `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL`, so the local workflow cannot silently route through a relay. See [docs/LOCAL_SETUP.zh-CN.md](docs/LOCAL_SETUP.zh-CN.md).

The upstream project supports an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint through the `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` environment variable. That behavior is not active in this branch.

---


#### 🟡 (Optional) Enable Password Validation
```dotenv
APP_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```
When `APP_PASSWORD` is set, the frontend will prompt you for a password to authenticate requests.

### 2. Install Dependencies 🟢

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
# or
# pnpm install
# or
# bun install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server 🟢

On Windows, double-click `start-local.cmd` (or run `node scripts/start-local.mjs`). It binds to `127.0.0.1`, prefers port `3000`, and prints the actual URL if `3000` is occupied.

```bash
npm run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3000
```

### 4. Open the Playground 🟢

Open the URL printed by the launcher (normally [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)) in your web browser.
